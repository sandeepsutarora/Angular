Databinding = communication between TypeScript code (Business Logic) to the Template (HTML).
1. output Data 
     String Interploation ({{ data}})
     Property Binding ([property]="data")
     
2. React to (User) Events
   Event Binding ((event )= "expression")
   
3. Combination of both Two-Way-Binding ([(ngModel)]="data")


4. String Interpolation
    1. Created new module called StringInterpolation using ng g c StringInterpolation, which created defalut
       entry in app.module including import and adding in the declaration of @ngModule
    2. Further created String interpolation in HTML file and from component return/assigned variables/methods that values.
       
5. Property Binding
   1.
   2. 
   
6. Property Binding vs String Interpolation


7. Event Binding
   (event)="method()"
   (click)="onCreateServer()"


8. Two way data binding.
   needs to enable ngModel directive adding the FormsModule to the imports array in the appModule.
   Also beeds to add important from @angular/forms in the app.module.ts file;
   import { FormsModule }  from @angular/foms.
